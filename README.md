## Abstract

Repository hosting the final work achieved during the CHIC 2017/2018 project by students from EPFL, ECAL and UNIL. In the repo it is possible to access both Software and Firmware resources generated, as well as the research project paper we wrote to help us contextualize even more the whole experience in the Chinese reality.

The team NAPaC identified itself in the Toygether brand image, that clearly showcases the goal of the whole project. We aim to develop a connected peluche for young kids, allowing them to stay connected with simple interractions with their parents when those are not physically available for personal or working motives.

## Repo structure

## 1. File hierarchy

The different files are organized like in the tree structure below. The three main folders, `Firmware`, `Software` and `SHS`, separate our main different contents we worked on.
