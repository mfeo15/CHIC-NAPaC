% 1) Definition of "technology of communication"
% 2) Definition of Rural China
% 3) Definition of "left-behind"

An increasing number of children in Chinese rural areas live far away from their parents, as about 80\% of the migrant workers leave their children “behind” in their home-village (\cite{guo2017effect}). The goal of our research is to understand whether a technology of communication embedded in a smart toy could be helpful for families within the 50\% of children, left-behind by one or both parents joining the labor force in the cities (\cite{bai2017effect}).\\

[Introduction of the phenomenon on a global perspective (Mexico, Philippines, Romania, etc). Relate the Chinese context with other local realities, more accessible from Switzerland, where interviews could be done and then relate the synthesis with the Chinese reality.]\\

%A literature review will first showcase related work and previous investigations regarding left behind children, a common circumstance in China and developing countries. Once the context is set and a common ground of knowledge given, the methodology of research will expose the objectives and approaches to reach them. Then, a synthesis and analysis of results from the research will be processed, before drawing conclusive remarks.

To illustrate our work on the topic presented, we will split this research into several sections: (\ref{related-work}) Related work - a literature review showcasing related work and previous investigations regarding left behind children; (\ref{methods}) Methods - exposing the objectives we settled and the approaches to reach them; (\ref{results}) Results - presenting both synthesis and analysis we will derive from the results obtained; and (\ref{conclusion}) Conclusions - our final remarks and future scenarios on the presented work.
