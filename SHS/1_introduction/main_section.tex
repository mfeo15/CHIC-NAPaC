% 1) Definition of "technology of communication"
% 2) Definition of Rural China
% 3) Definition of "left-behind"

An increasing number of children in Chinese rural areas live far away from their parents, as about 80\% (Effect of Parental Migration on Children’s Health in Rural China, Qian Guo et al., 2017) of the migrant workers leave their children “behind” in their home-village. The goal of our research is to understand whether a smart toy could also be helpful for families in Chinese rural areas, where 50\% (Effect of Parental Migration on the Academic Performance of Left-behind Children in Northwestern China, Yu Bai et al., May 2016) of children are left-behind by one or both parents, who migrated to join the labor force in the cities.\\

The aimed goal settled in this introduction is presented in the this paper that we split into several sections: (\ref{related-work}) Related work - a literature review of the domain highlighting the existing coverage available on the topic; (\ref{methods}) Methods - showing how the core exploration has been tackled by use of appropriated interviews; (\ref{results}) Results - contains our analysis that we derived from the research process; and (\ref{conclusion}) Conclusions - our final remarks and future scenarios on the presented work.
