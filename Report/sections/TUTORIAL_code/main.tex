\section{Code snippets}
\label{sec:code}

Code snippets are inserted via listings in \TeX, which need to be correctly defined for each language inside the main file of the whole document. Python is already provided, while the others should be done in order to match the IDE aesthetics design. The code snippets should be stored in their correct folder (according to language) in the code\_snippets directory.
