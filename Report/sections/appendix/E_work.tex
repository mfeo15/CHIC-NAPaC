\section{Work distribution and personal conclusions}
\label{appendix:work_distribution}

Who did what and when? We can all write something like max 10 lines to say "I did this and this and this" and with whom we did it.

\subsection{Tools}
We used Trello, Slack, GDrive, Teamweek and a nice cardboard pannel but it was a bit too many tools and in the end we only used half of thembut while we used them they were cool to see who was doing what.

\subsection{Who did what?}
    \subsubsection{Chloe}
I baked a cake and it was delicious. I went very often to ECAL and did many Skype calls with Estelle and Yann tried to explain his black magic to me. I took orders from Luca for the interactions and gave orders to Simone about the PCB shape.

\subsection{Our goals for China and next semester}
    \subsubsection{Chloe}
I want to save WiFi SmartConfigs to EEPROM, implement sleep functions and implement a nice sound system. In mechanical design, I would like to implement a sleek user-friendly connector and bring the blackbox to its minimal form factor to minimise electronics intrusion in toy.

\subsection{What I learnt}
    \subsubsection{Chloe} 
I learned how to implement FW for a HW prototype from scratch while using libraries and existing functions and tweaking them to my needs.I adapted to designer work method to collaborate successively, and learned how to manage my work and team in a large project with many team members and supervisors with each their own tasks and requirements.
